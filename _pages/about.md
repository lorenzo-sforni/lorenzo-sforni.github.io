Hi there, I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the Center for Research on Complex Automated Systems (CASY), Department of Electrical and Information Engineering “Guglielmo Marconi”, University of Bologna.
<br>
<br>
My research interests lie in the intersection between learning-driven optimal control, reinforcement learning, and distributed optimal control.
<br>
<br>
My Ph.D. project, supervised by 
<a href='https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/giuseppe.notarstefano/en'>Professor Giuseppe Notarstefano</a>, looks at innovative optimal control strategies for complex systems. Specifically, I follow two main research paths: (i) optimal control for unknown/uncertain systems and reinforcement learning, (ii) design of distributed optimal control algorithms in multi-robot scenarios.
<br>
<br>
Currently, I am a Visiting Researcher advised by <a href='http://ames.caltech.edu'>Professor Aaron Ames</a>, at <a href='http://www.bipedalrobotics.com'>AMBER Lab</a>, Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering, Caltech.

<!-- Hi there, I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the Center for Research on Complex Automated Systems (CASY), Department of Electrical and Information Engineering “Guglielmo Marconi”, University of Bologna.

My research interests lie in the intersection between learning-driven optimal control, reinforcement learning, and distributed nonlinear optimal control.

My Ph.D. project, supervised by [Professor Giuseppe Notarstefano](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/giuseppe.notarstefano/en), looks at innovative optimal control strategies for complex systems. 
I follow two main research paths: (i) optimal control for unknown/uncertain systems and reinforcement learning , (ii) design of distributed optimal control algorithms in multi-robot scenarios.

Currently, I am a Visiting Researcher advised by [Professor Aaron Ames](http://ames.caltech.edu), at [AMBER Lab](http://www.bipedalrobotics.com), Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering of Caltech. -->
